**If you have any questions, the answer may be in our
[FAQ](https://www.speedrun.com/mcbe/thread/vdv9t)**

[Back](../README.md)

Any% Peaceful is exclusive (as of now) to Android due to the glitch needed to
run the category. The current duping method is done on Android version 1.2.6.1
(1.2.6.60) or 1.2.6.55.

* The glitch used is allowed on Any% Peaceful (Item Creation) ONLY. Not on any
other leaderboards unless explicitely stated otherwise.
* Timing ends the frame the screen begins to fade after exiting the end.
	- See the [timing rules](../global/README.md#timing-rules) regarding
	when timing begins.
