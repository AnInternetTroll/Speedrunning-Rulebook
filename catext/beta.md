[Back](../README.md)

This leaderboard was originally created to store runs for 1.16 betas that had
seeds broken after updates. There are also some features that arguably make
speedrunning 1.16 beta rsg easier/faster.

* All [Any% rules](../fullgame/any.md) apply to this category.
* You must play on a beta version of 1.16
* Seeds that are used on the main boards and work on both beta and full-release
are not allowed.
