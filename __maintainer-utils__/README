MAINTAINER UTILS
================
If you are not a maintainer of this repository, you can ignore this directory.
This directory simply contains a few scripts to make life easier, namely:

	- long.awk	Point out obnoxiously long lines
	- push.sh	Push any changes to both the main repo at git.mcbe.wtf
				and the github mirror
	- trim.sed	Trim any trailing whitespace

To use `long.awk` or `trim.sed` on all the files in the repository, you can use
the following command:

```
$ ./long.awk $(find ../ -not -type d -not -regex '^\.\./\.git.*')
```

No output means all is well.
