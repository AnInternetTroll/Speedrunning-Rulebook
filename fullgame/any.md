[Back](../README.md)

* Beat the game as fast as possible with no in-game restrictions.
* The use of glitches is required.
        - If you did not use glitches, submit to
        [Any% Glitchless](any-glitchless.md).
        - Any glitches used must provide some sort of advantage, performing a
        visual bug that does not affect gameplay to submit your glitchless run
        to glitched is forbidden.
* Timing ends the frame the screen begins to fade after exiting the end.
        - See the [timing rules](../global/README.md#timing-rules) regarding
        when timing begins.
