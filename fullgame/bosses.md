## All Bosses

* Must kill the following bosses:
	- The Ender Dragon
	- The Wither
	- The Elder Guardian
* The use of glitches is required.
	- If you did not use glitches, submit to
	[Kill Bosses Glitchless](bosses-glitchless.md).
	- Any glitches used must provide some sort of advantage, performing a
	visual bug that does not affect gameplay to submit your glitchless run
	to glitched is forbidden.
* Timing ends the frame the final boss entity fully disappears.
	- See the [timing rules](../global/README.md#timing-rules) regarding
	when timing begins.

## Wither

* The same rules apply as All Bosses, however you are only required to kill
the Wither.
