* Must complete all achievements excluding the following:
	- Passing the Time
	- Diamonds to You!
	- Time for Stew
	- Adventuring Time
	- Sail the 7 Seas
* You must show the achievements screen before (must have 0 achievements) and
after (show all attained achievements) the run.
* Timing ends when the requirement for the last achievement is completed, make
sure to write in the run description an approximate timestamp, so it's easier
for us to properly check whether the requirement has been met.
